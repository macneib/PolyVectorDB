# Requirements Specification: Multi-Value Vector Database (MVVD)

## Overview
The Multi-Value Vector Database (MVVD) is an experimental data model that enables entities to hold multiple vector embeddings simultaneously (text, image, metadata vectors) with the capability to perform cross-vector queries and reasoning. This represents a novel evolution beyond traditional single-vector databases toward a new class of multi-modal data models.

## Business Context
- **Target Users**: ML Engineers, Data Scientists, AI Application Developers
- **Business Value**: Enable multi-modal similarity search, reduce complexity of managing separate vector stores, improve query expressiveness
- **Success Metrics**: Query performance, memory efficiency, developer adoption, benchmarking against existing solutions

## User Stories

### Story 1: Multi-Vector Entity Creation
**As a** ML Engineer  
**I want** to create entities with multiple named vector fields  
**So that** I can store related embeddings (text, image, metadata) in a single coherent entity

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN a user creates an entity with multiple vector fields (e.g., "text_embedding", "image_embedding", "metadata_embedding")
THE SYSTEM SHALL store all vectors with their associated names and maintain entity coherence

WHEN a user specifies vector dimensions for each field
THE SYSTEM SHALL validate dimensions and enforce consistency within each field type

WHEN a user attempts to add a vector field with invalid dimensions
THE SYSTEM SHALL reject the operation and return a descriptive error message

### Story 2: Cross-Vector Query Execution
**As a** Data Scientist  
**I want** to perform queries across multiple vector fields with different similarity metrics  
**So that** I can find entities that match criteria across multiple modalities

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN a user submits a query with multiple vector inputs and similarity metrics (e.g., cosine on text + L2 on image)
THE SYSTEM SHALL compute similarity scores for each vector field independently

WHEN a user specifies a combination strategy (weighted average, min, max, custom function)
THE SYSTEM SHALL combine the individual similarity scores according to the specified strategy

WHEN a user requests top-k results from a cross-vector query
THE SYSTEM SHALL return ranked results with individual and combined similarity scores

### Story 3: Pluggable Storage Backend
**As a** System Administrator  
**I want** to configure different storage backends (in-memory, disk-based)  
**So that** I can optimize for different performance and persistence requirements

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN a user configures the in-memory storage backend
THE SYSTEM SHALL store all data in RAM and provide fastest query performance

WHEN a user configures a disk-based storage backend
THE SYSTEM SHALL persist data to disk and reload on system restart

WHEN a user switches between storage backends
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain data consistency and provide migration capabilities

### Story 4: Extensible Indexing System
**As a** Performance Engineer  
**I want** to experiment with different indexing algorithms (FAISS-like, custom ANN)  
**So that** I can optimize query performance for specific use cases

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN a user configures a specific index type for a vector field
THE SYSTEM SHALL build the appropriate index structure for that field

WHEN a user performs similarity search on an indexed field
THE SYSTEM SHALL use the index to accelerate query execution

WHEN a user benchmarks different index types
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide performance metrics (build time, query time, memory usage)

### Story 5: High-Performance API Access
**As a** Application Developer  
**I want** to access MVVD through both Rust-native and network APIs  
**So that** I can integrate with different application architectures

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN a Rust application uses the native API
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide zero-copy access and optimal performance

WHEN a client connects via gRPC
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide type-safe, efficient serialization/deserialization

WHEN a client connects via REST API
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide HTTP-based access with JSON payloads

### Story 6: Benchmarking and Performance Monitoring
**As a** Performance Engineer  
**I want** comprehensive benchmarking tools  
**So that** I can measure and optimize system performance

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN a user runs throughput benchmarks
THE SYSTEM SHALL measure operations per second for insert, update, delete, and query operations

WHEN a user runs latency benchmarks
THE SYSTEM SHALL measure p50, p95, p99 latencies for all operations

WHEN a user compares performance against baseline implementations
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide comparative metrics and detailed profiling data

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
WHEN the system processes concurrent queries
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain sub-millisecond query latency for in-memory operations

WHEN the system handles large datasets (>1M entities)
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain linear or sub-linear scaling characteristics

WHEN the system operates under memory pressure
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide graceful degradation without crashes

### Security Requirements
WHEN a client connects to the network APIs
THE SYSTEM SHALL support authentication and authorization mechanisms

WHEN sensitive vector data is processed
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide options for encryption at rest and in transit

### Reliability Requirements
WHEN the system encounters invalid input
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide clear error messages and maintain system stability

WHEN the system experiences hardware failures
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide data consistency guarantees for persistent storage

### Scalability Requirements
WHEN the system needs to handle increased load
THE SYSTEM SHALL support horizontal scaling through modular architecture

WHEN vector dimensions increase significantly
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain performance through efficient memory management
